                In 1898 three people died of the plague in Vienna. The last plague outbrake before that 
                lay over 150 years in the past. <br>Additionally the cases were not caused by natural contagion 
                but were due to a laboratory accident. No wonder this incident sparked general fear and heated media coverage.<br>
                The media of the time was the newspaper. <br>The following web page experience is dedicated to retelling the events
                through artificial newspaper articles. This means the articles were never printed this way. In fact most of the details surfaced much later. 
                Still the story told was 
                researched in detail. We want to make events relatable and engaging by emulating the newspaper style of the time. 
                This includes the use of old style <span class="fraktur">fraktur script</span>.

                    It is the year 1897. The great plague epidemics in Europe are long past. 
                    And even though no one alive can remember, the fear of the disease lingers in the collective mind. 
                    It is therefore of general concern that a major epidemic is spreading again in Asia. 
                    Increased travel and trade might even bring the plague back to our doors.

                        made public his discovery of a bacterium that is the cause of the plague illness. But still there 
                        is no cure and the epidemic has spread from Hong Kong, where Yersin made his experiments and is 
                        now raging in Bombay, India, where people die on a daily basis from the plague.<br>
                        As there is fear the epidemic might still spread further the Imperial Academy od Sciences has 
                        decided yesterday to send an expedition to Bombay. The expedition staff will consist of three doctors 
                        one assistant and one servant. Dr. Hermann Müller, some 31 years young, will take the lead.

                    What exciting times we live in. The rapid advancement of sciences enabled our audacious doctors to 
                    bring back plague cultures from their expedition. The Academy is now looking for feasible rooms to 
                    conduct experiments with the pathogen. Maybe Vienny will be the place to find a cure for this ancient 
                    curse of mankind.<br>
                    Until a suitable location is found our brave man deservedly spend a recreational vacation. The rumour 
                    is that the plague room will be set up within the pathological institute of Prof. Nothnagel at the 
                    Vienna General Hospital.

                        conducted animal experiments and also keep the infected laboratory animals. This will ring the alarm 
                        bells of those concerned members of the municipal council who intervened in front of the mayor 
                        against the installation of such a facility on Feruary 26th. We all hope the general discomfort eminating 
                        from the notorious article in the Wiener Tagblatt that warned of a "plague pathogen plantation"

                    The death of reliable servant of the Institute of Pathology and Anatomy Franz Barisch, who was well 
                    aware of the dangers of his position as an animal keeper is a tragedy. It was around the time of the last scheduled experiments with only one guinea 
                    alive that Barisch contracted pneumonic plague.

                        with influenza on October 15th. Dr. Müller must have had mixed feelings about the 
                        cause of the illness because he transferred the patient into isolation in the General Hospital and had his flat in the Narrenturm disinfected.
                        We have no confirmation of any final diagnosis, but it is said, that Barisch's wife was refused to see him before he died.<br>

                        with a disinfectant liquid after each intrusive manipulation and were not allowed to leave even during their free time, 
                        which Hochecker particularly noticed. According to reports, Pecha is very frightened and often has to be reassured by the 
                        resolute Hochecker, especially as the nurses will have to remain in isolation for the foreseeable future.

                        Josef Hospital, which was only opened by the Emperor in 1891, is an extensive complex of buildings to the south of the city, 
                        enclosed on all sides by a wall and not connected to each other. The so-called “pavilion system” was specifically designed 
                        to contain epidemics. When rumours of an isolated patient in the general hospital spread in here the last few days, there was 
                        probably a lack of understanding among the doctors as to why he was not immediately transferred to this specialized facility 
                        and at the same time unease about the potential danger of the plague.<br>
                        We hear that city officials are at the infection control department of the Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital this morning to inspect

                    At 1 p.m. on October 20, a car was said to be on its way from the General Hospital to the Franz Josef Hospital. 
                    Two medical cyclists rush towards it, the tension reaches its climax - then the dark gate of the infectious disease ward opens 
                    and the important carriage comes right up to the expectance barrack, which, together with the surrounding lawn, is demarcated 
                    by a rope stretched from tree to tree. The carriage opens and Dr. Müller swings down light-footedly. He looks a little pale and a 
                    little affected and manages to almost completely conceal his understandable excitement. He introduces himself to the director of 
                    Franz Josef Hospital and the doctors 
                    from the infectious diseases department - but only two of them take Dr. Müller's 
                    offered hand, although he remarks wittily: “I'm not ill, the doctor is not infectious.”

                        to contain the plague outbreak to the Kaiser Franz Joseph hospital. Dr. Müller has joined the nurses Hochecker and Pecha in isolation in a small 
                        pavilion called the "expectance barrack" on the grounds of the Franz Joseph Hospital. This hut was specifically designed to accept 
                        suspected cases of severe infectious diseases. Our informants tell us that, Dr. Müller was feeling well and convened with the Doctors of the Franz Joseph 
                        hospital. He was amused by the strictness of the quarantine provisions and had no premonition of carrying the bacillus himself.
                        Nevertheless, each of the three moved into separate rooms in the isolation hut. The rooms are 
                        each connected to one other room housing nurses from the Franz Josef Hospital for every patient. No one is allowed to leave 
                        except for Müller for his regular visits to the other patients.

                        many precautions taken by the Franz Josef Hospital to contain the dissease. The measures relate to the three patients and 
                        three seasoned nurses from the center for infectious disseases.
                        The people in the barracks are cut off from any direct contact with the outside world. The food is carried to them by 
                        the servant who is exclusively assigned to these tasks and emptied into bowls placed on the windowsill of a room 
                        adjacent to the actual sickrooms. Similarly, the delivery of documents, utensils, medicines etc. is never carried 
                        out from hand to hand, but is placed there by the servant and taken over by the nurses after he has removed them. 
                        During off-duty hours, they are allowed to walk on the lawn within the cordon to get some fresh air, a very important 
                        measure! A bell pull leading from Dr. Müller's door into the inspection room on the infection floor, where someone must 
                        always be present due to the permanent telephone service The bell, which leads from Dr. Müller's door into the inspection 
                        room of the infection floor, where someone must always be present due to the permanent telephone service, indicates 
                        that something is wanted from the internees; an appeal that must always be considered before anything else. Any contact, 
                        indeed any excessive approach, seems to be avoided by this system, but only if it is carried out with the utmost care and 
                        rigor. strictness. Three guards, who have to take over from each other every eight hours, patrol the cordon to ensure 
                        that no unauthorized person enters it. 
                        Separate wooden boxes that can be directed by the nurse to hold the waste, which is to be thoroughly mixed with peat 
                        dust in the bucket so that any liquid is absorbed. The contents of the buckets must be emptied into these boxes, the box 
                        closed, the outside thoroughly wiped with 5% carbolic solution and then placed by the attendant in the trolley pushed up 
                        to the entrance door; these boxes must then be driven to the incinerator and thrown into the furnace by the disinfection 
                        attendant, whose hands must be protected by cloths dipped in sublimate solution.

                    The unthinkable has come true. We have now certainty that both Albine Pecha and Dr. Müller carry the plague pathogen. 
                    In fact, Müller already presented so clearly the image of a sick person that the nurse had him take his body temperature. 
                    This happened around noon on October 21. The measurement showed 38.2 degrees - in combination with a cough and sputum, 
                    as in Pecha, a symptom that could not be misunderstood.
                    Dr. Müller had sent Pecha's sputum, which looked quite characteristic, to the prosectory for examination. 
                    His own, which looked very much like that of his fellow sufferer, was sent at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
                    A mere 70 hours after the first death, of the three people who had been working 
                    around Barisch, two now seem to be irretrievably lost, including the doctor, who was not even supposed 
                    to be "infectious" - a downright devastating realization!

                        imminent threat. The city has established a permanent commitee and has gone into emergency mode. The General Hospital has closed 
                        off the whole section where the infected had been lying and working. Further persons that are thought to have been in 
                        contact with the deceased Barisch are being isolated.
                        Next to the Franz Joseph Hospital workers are erecting plague barracks to house large numbers of infected people as a matter of precaution. 
                        The sewers are searched for dead rats. We fear that the general commotion is fuelled by ever more unconfirmed rumors in pertinent newspapers.

                    The whole city is shaken by the story of the plague outbrake. Of course there is a lingering fear, but most of all people are moved by the 
                    fate of the innocent Albine Pecha and the brave Dr. Müller, who brought the bcillus from India himself but also showed true 
                    courage in dealing with the outbreak. He is still attending his two patients and it is said that he most probably contracted the 
                    plague himself while he was when he personally scraped the floor and walls of the insulation room at Nothnagel's until 4 a.m. and 
                    cleaned them with carbolic acid and did not allow anyone else to do so.

                        Dr. Müller sits on the edge of the bed, his hands folded on his knees, unmoving, his gaze 
                        steady. At a loss for words, he nods his consent, strikes the cross, and taps his chest. 
                        Tears are in his eyes when the priest asks him if he forgives everyone as God forgives him.
